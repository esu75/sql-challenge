# sql-challenge
Module_9 challenge   a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s.
All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files
For this project, I designed the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and identify PRIMARY and FOREIGN KEYS.
Finally, perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.
